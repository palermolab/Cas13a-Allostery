1. GC_based_mapping_of_Network.ipynb: 
Create network files following the Generalized Correlation data using the _Dynetan_ Package from work titled **"Generalized correlation-based dynamical network analysis: a new high-performance approach for identifying allosteric communications in molecular dynamics trajectories", by Marcelo C. R. Melo, Rafael C. Bernardi, Cesar de la Fuente-Nunez, and Zaida Luthey-Schulten**

2. Path_Anaysis.ipynb:
   Read the network files created by _GC_based_mapping_of_Network.ipynb_ to perform SNR calculation to detect allosteric signals and find residues crucial for communication.
