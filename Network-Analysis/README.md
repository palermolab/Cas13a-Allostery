1. GC_based_mapping_of_Network.ipynb: 
Create network files following the Generalized Correlation data using the _Dynetan_ Package from the following work:

Melo, M. C. R.; Bernardi, R. C.; de la Fuente-Nunez, C.; Luthey-Schulten, Z. **Generalized Correlation-Based Dynamical Network Analysis: A New High-Performance Approach for Identifying Allosteric Communications in Molecular Dynamics Trajectories.** _J. Chem. Phys. 2020, 153 (13)_, 134104.

3. Path_Anaysis.ipynb:
   Read the network files created by _GC_based_mapping_of_Network.ipynb_ to perform SNR calculation to detect allosteric signals and find residues crucial for communication.
